					<h2>A few things about me..</h2>
				</div>
				<div data-aos="fade-up">
					<h4>My Education</h4>
					<p>My Name, as you have most likely alredy seen, is Ivan Berry Erpacic. But I just go by Berry.<br>I'm 27 and I live in Ochsenhausen, Baden-WÃ¼rttenberg in Germany.
					I did an apprenticeship as a car mechatronics technician, electrician for energy and building technology and now also IT specialist for application development.
					Yes it took me some time to find my place but I'm finally there. It might have been better to start with IT from the get go but I dont regret the education I have accumulated.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-aos="fade-up">
					<h4>My Hobbyes</h4>
					<p>The most frequent things I do in my spare time? Well I did like to play video games a lot, but meanwhile I dont play as much. More often you would find me either 
					coding or watching a movie. You could say I had my fill on video games. I realised it might be fun from time to time but it looses its charm if you play on a regular basis.
					And I could have been using my time to learn more as I do now.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-aos="fade-up">
					<h4>My Personality</h4>
					<p>I consider myself to be calm, friendly, honest, considerate and team capable introvert. What does that mean? It means that don't engage in smalltalk much but that also 
					depends on the relatioship between us. That does not affect working in a team because I do have exclent comunication skills and working in a team has meaning and can't be considered "smalltalk".
					As said I am a calm person and it would take a lot of effort to offend me. Here I could cover the "considerate" part of me. Meaning that I don't judge anybody based on their belives or oppinions.
					Honest? Yes very much so. If I have an issue or fail somewhere I won't try to hide the fact I did something wrong. Everybody fails sometimes and that's ok. We are human and nobody is perfect.
					You would have to meet me to make your own oppinion about me.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-aos="fade-up">
					<h4>My strengths</h4>
					<p>Aside from things mentioned above I learn very fast, appreciate clean code and aim to write clean code myself.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-aos="fade-up">
					<h4>My weaknesses</h4>
					<p>Well I tend to spend much time on details and if I'm not invested/interested in the work I do, my attentionspan is short.</p>
